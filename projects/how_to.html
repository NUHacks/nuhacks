  <h1>How to make a thing</h1>

  <p>You'll need these things</p>

  <h2>An idea</h2>

  <p>An app to track when someone does something around the house,
    and give them points, with the agreement that the person with the
    least points must buy the person with the most points a meal at
    the end of the weak.</p>

  <h2>A platform</h2>

  <p>It's going to be on the web duh...</p>

  <h2>A procedure</h2>

  <p>I'm going to write it in HTML and ruby.</p>
  <p>If you're not sure how to make your idea, that's what hacks is all
    about, come... talk... learn. Cool smart people are there.</p>
