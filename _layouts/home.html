          <h2>One of Hacks members’ favorite pastimes is trying to describe what Hacks is. Here are some that we think are memorable:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Hacks is a place where cool people build cool stuff because it's cool</li>
            <li>Tech tastemakers</li>
            <li>We sit around and watch train videos</li>
            <li>Social club for nerds</li>
            <li>Hacks is like being swaddled inside of a maternity sweater while another person is also in that sweater. It’s
              warm and snuggly and of course you both fit</li>
            <li>You know, we sit around, hack the pentagon, usually with our ally, the hacker known as 4chan.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>If you want to add your own description come to a hacks meeting or email
